# To-do-List
 This is a simple to-do list website created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to add, remove, and modify items on their to-do list. Clicking the "Add" button generates a random blue gradient background for the webpage. The buttons are right-aligned for better visual appeal.
